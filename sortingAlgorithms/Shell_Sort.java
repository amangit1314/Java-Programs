// Problem Title => Implement She'll Sort

/*
* ShellSort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort.
* In insertion sort, we move elements only one position ahead.
* When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements are involved.
* The idea of shellSort is to allow exchange of far items.
* In shellSort, we make the arrays.array h-sorted for a large value of h.
* We keep reducing the value of h until it becomes
* 1. An arrays.array is said to be h-sorted if all sub-linkedList.list's of every hâ€™th element is sorted.
